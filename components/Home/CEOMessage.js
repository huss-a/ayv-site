        Hello! I’m Gabriel, and I’m the CEO of Finnair Virtual. I’ve been in
        the VA since the start and the CEO since November 2020. I have loved
        aviation since I first saw a plane, 10 years ago. In AYVA, we strive to
        create a professional and friendly experience, and we want to become one
        of the biggest VAs in Infinite Flight. So what are you waiting for? Come
        Fly Finnish with us!
